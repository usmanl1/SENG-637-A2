# 1 Introduction

In this lab exercise, our goal is to implement unit testing for two Java classes within a program, with detailed specifications provided in the Java documentation. To accomplish this, we utilized JUnit frameworks to construct a testing environment comprising mock objects and test cases. The primary objectives of the lab were to acquaint ourselves with Eclipse, set up a project incorporating specified JAR files, and gain proficiency in Eclipse's JUnit functionality. Additionally, the lab focused on analyzing Java documentation, guiding us to create test cases for the specified classes. During the test case creation process, we were assigned the task of constructing partitions for the selected methods under test. These partitions served as the foundation for developing comprehensive test cases, ensuring a thorough and accurate assessment of each method's functionality.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

### Test Methods for Range Class ###
